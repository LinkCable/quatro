This is the fourth edition of my personal website.

It's built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and various React Three.js plugins including [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [react-three-drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei).

The repo name is a reference to a Gundam character, hidden somewhere on my portfolio.
